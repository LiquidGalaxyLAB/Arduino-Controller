### __Welcome, know a little more about the project__

This project was developed to act as a remote controller for Liquid Galaxy. With this controller the user will be able to interact with Liquid Galaxy in a more dynamic way, using a remote control that can be connected to Liquid Galaxy using a USB cable or just connecting to the same internet network via WiFi.
This project has two different controllers, the first, and more complete, has:
* Joystick for navigation;
* Ultrasonic sensor for zoom change;
* Matrix keyboard for direct navigation to predefined places;
* Buttons with special interaction functions;
* Voice recognition module

The other control is based on a controller glove, this glove has an accelerometer sensor that reads the user's hand movements and converts them into navigation movements on the Liquid Galaxy, this device also has connection characteristics similar to the first control presented and also has some interaction and navigation buttons.

 ### __Android app__
 This project also has an Android application that should be used to personalize navigation with the developed controllers. This application has a friendly and intuitive interface, with simple commands and connections for sending data to the controllers. Using this application the user will be able to:
* Change the default navigation list of controls;
* Create personalized navigation lists with your favorite places;
* Change the tour time during the tour;
* Start the connection to the WiFi network between the controls and the Liquid Galaxy and update the network data, if necessary;
* Learn a little more about GSoC, the Liquid Galaxy community and the whole project and its collaborators on the information page.
